what in the world is this
- plant electrical signal reader

but why
- don't worry about it

to setup:
- clone repo
- `python3 -m venv venv`
- `source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

to run:
- run `arduino plant_voltage_piper` to open the ide and the arduino script. There are ways to upload without this ide but those are left as exercieses for whoever decided to open this repo
- compile and upload (after uploading can close ide if no need to edit)
- activate the python venv and run `hello.py` to start tracking -- this should restart the program every time it's run.
